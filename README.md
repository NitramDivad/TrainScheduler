# **Train Scheduler **

Week 07 Homework Assignment....

Train Scheduler will be written using JQuery, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Also incorporated is the use of Google's Firebase.

Following are notes about the Train Scheduler:

    1.  The scheduler will allow multiple train schedule entries
    2.  When adding a new train, the First Train Time should be entered in Military Time Format (ie. 13:00 = 1:00pm)
    3.  When adding a new train, the Frequency should be an integer value greater than 0
    4.  Once the Submit button is clicked, a new record is added and "highlighted" as an indication of successful addition
    5.  The Schedule will provide the following:
        a. Train Name
        b. Destination
        c. Frequency (minutes)
        d. Next Arrival Time
        e. Minutes Away
